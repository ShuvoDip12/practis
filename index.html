        Marina Ovsyannikova, the former Russian state TV journalist who protested against the war during a live broadcast, has been convicted of discrediting the country's armed forces in anti-war social media posts.

Ovsyannikova was an editor at the government-controlled Channel One at the beginning of the war - but on 14 March she interrupted the channel’s main evening news bulletin and held up a poster calling on viewers not to "believe the propaganda".

She lost her job and was fined 30,000 roubles (£407).

Today's trial <span>focused on subsequent </span>social media posts in which she wrote that those responsible for Russia's actions in Ukraine would find themselves in the dock before an international tribunal. She was fined 50,000 roubles (£677).

In court, she described the war as "horror, blood and shame" and insisted “the purpose of the trial is to intimidate all the people who oppose the war" in Russia, Reuters reports.

Describing her country as an aggressor, the news agency also quotes Ovsyannikova as saying the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February "is the biggest crime of our government".

Ovsyannikova described the proceedings as "absurd" but the judge said the evidence confirmed her guilt and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity.
